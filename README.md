Game Moments is a platform that allows you to collect iconic NFT moments from esports disciplines. Here you can buy special sets that include one or more highlights from Dota 2 and CS:GO games. You can also buy moments in the store, share them with other users, and sell them. First of all, the project is aimed at collecting, for those who love esports and everything related to it.

On the site, users set their own prices for their collection. You can sell both individual moments and an entire collection. Special kits will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Now the system of random queues is very common. I don't think that's quite fair. A live queue system will be implemented on Game Moments. The purchase will not be made at one time, everyone can get in line 2 hours before the start of sales, everyone will see the number of their queue immediately. This will save time for others, and allow real collectors to gain access to the purchase.

Protection against bots will be introduced by implementing the latest version of the captcha. Multiaccounts, the use of VPN is prohibited, the system will strictly monitor such actions and instantly ban violators without the possibility of a refund. These problems constantly prevent real collectors from getting the most out of the NFT realm. And first of all, all efforts will be directed to solving these problems.

Each user will have their own profile, where they can create a showcase of their moments. Here, he can also see his progress in completing tasks and getting achievements. Each achievement adds a certain amount of points. When you reach the desired number of points, the user will be able to get a special reward - an additional set of moments.

Also, collectors will have the opportunity to arrange battles among themselves-comparing their moments with each other. Each moment will have its own characteristics, which will allow you to build a strong collection. In addition, users will be able to create clans and arrange clan battles, the winners of which will receive experience points and additional prizes. The key feature of the platform for users is the presence of a chat. Each user will be able to communicate with each other online via the built-in chat, add friends.

All moments will be NFT, which will contain the most iconic moments in the history of esports games such as Dota 2 and CS: GO. There will be several rarities: common, uncommon, rare, mythical, and legendary (forbidden for CS).

The main task of the project is to create a platform for real collectors, without multiaccounts, bots, and speculators. This will be the most transparent resource, which will include only moments from Dota 2 and CS: GO, so as not to turn into a dump of a bunch of different projects.

Key features: live communication, rewards for points, live queue, community creation, clan battles.
